  A quasi-parabolic approach for inverting ionograms
 
</div>

## Abstract
Building upon the concept of utilizing quasi-parabolic approximations to determine plasma frequency profiles from ionograms, we present a refined multi-quasi-parabolic method for modeling the E and F layers. While a recent study AIP Advances 14 065034 introduced an approach in this direction, we identified several inaccuracies in its mathematical treatment and numerical results. By addressing these issues, we offer a clearer exposition and a more robust algorithm. Our method assumes a parabolic profile for the E layer and approximates the F layer with a series of concatenated quasi-parabolic segments, ensuring continuity and smoothness by matching derivatives at the junctions. Applied to daylight ionograms from the Jicamarca Observatory in Lima, our inversion algorithm demonstrates excellent agreement between the synthetic ionograms generated from our predicted plasma frequency profiles and the original measured data.

Refer to the accompanying [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09215) for a more detailed description of the mathematics and algorithms used.
## Results
We used data provided by the Jicamarca Radio Observatory located in Lima, Peru. The data is a .SAO file thus providing all the information of the iongram such as the E and F layer critical frequency and the o-mode trace. We find that the program works for ionograms with E and F layer or daytime ionograms.

On top of predicting the electron density profile or, as well known as plasma frequency profile, we can predict the complete form of the E layer which is usually incomplete in the ionograms.

## How to use
This program expects `.SAO` files, which are commonly used for sharing remote sensing data. These files should be placed in the `/sao_files/` directory. To run the program, simply execute `python3 main.py` in your terminal. As the algorithm solves for the E and F layers, you will see a progress bar. The `avoid_date_list.txt` file lists dates with poor-quality ionograms that should be avoided; otherwise, the program will stop. The final image comparing the results should resemble the examples shown above.
